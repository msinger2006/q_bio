Plethora Team:

Attached is my solution to the Plethora Technical Exercise. Compiling
the code requires the jsoncpp-master library for parsing the json profile
files. The jsoncpp-master library is found here:

github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp

To compile the code at the command line, perform these steps

g++ -c Vertex.cpp
g++ -c Edge.cpp
g++ -c -I/home/janedoe/json/jsoncpp-master/include main.cpp
g++ -o main main.o /home/janedoe/json/jsoncpp-master/build/debug/lib/libjsoncpp.a ./Vertex.o ./Edge.o

where /home/janedoe... is replaced with the proper path of jsoncpp-master.
Once compiled, the executable is "main", and the program is executed
by typing, e.g., "main Rectangle.json".

Alternative, use the CMakeLists.txt file to compile using cmake as follows:

cmake .
make

Note: Be sure to change the JSON_PARSER variable in CMakeLists.txt
to point to your local directory that contains jsoncpp-master.

If more time were available, I would focus on the following:
- code testing with more complex profiles
- add robustness to the code and fail gracefully when appropriate, e.g.,
  make sure pointers aren't null, use smart pointers, exceptions,...

If questions arise, please contact me.

Thank you.
